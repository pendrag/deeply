# deeply
A simple, from the scratch, Python module for "learning" deep learning.

Deeply is inspired in Andrew Ng's course on deep learning and its aim is to enable people to tweek and understand basics of deep learning, so new activation functions, optimization or regularization algorithms can be tested.
